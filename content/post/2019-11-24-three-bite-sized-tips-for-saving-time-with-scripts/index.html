<h2>Scripting, or how to make your computer take care of the boring stuff while you focus on what really matters: <del>napping</del> content</h2>
<p>Producing content can be hard regardless of wheter you’re working on a manuscript, a blog post or on a data analysis project.
This process involves coming up with your content—which is tough on its own—and a whole bunch of repetitive tasks that are important to your end-product and to future-you.
The latter consume your time, your focus, and increase the amount of typing you have to do.
Fortunately, you can leave a good portion of these repetitive tasks to someone that doesn’t really mind repetition and happens to be quite good at it: your computer.
All you have to do give it some instructions and that’s what you’ll find in this post.</p>

<h3>Application #1: Creating a folder structure using bash</h3>
<p>The first step in every project is to give it a home in your computer. Creating an informative folder structure makes organizing your files a no-brainer, which is great! It’s also completely mechanical process so let’s put our computer in charge of doing that for us. We can do it using bash.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>mkdir data data/raw_data data/tidy_data

mkdir code code/raw_code code/final_code

mkdir figures figures/exploratory figures/explanatory

mkdir products products/writing</code></pre>
