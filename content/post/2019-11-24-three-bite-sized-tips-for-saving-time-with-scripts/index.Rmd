## Scripting, or how to make your computer take care of the boring stuff while you focus on what really matters: ~~napping~~ content

Producing content can be hard regardless of wheter you're working on a manuscript, a blog post or on a data analysis project.
This process involves coming up with your content---which is tough on its own---and a whole bunch of repetitive tasks that are important to your end-product and to future-you.
The latter consume your time, your focus, and increase the amount of typing you have to do.
Fortunately, you can leave a good portion of these repetitive tasks to someone that doesn't really mind repetition and happens to be quite good at it: your computer.
All you have to do give it some instructions and that's what you'll find in this post.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="This doesn't have to be you. Unless you happen to be a cat who likes typing. Even so, it's your call."}
knitr::include_graphics("cat_typing.gif")
```


### Application #1: Creating a folder structure using bash


The first step in every project is to give it a home in your computer. Creating an informative folder structure makes organizing your files a no-brainer, which is great! It's also completely mechanical process so let's put our computer in charge of doing that for us. We can do it using bash.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mkdir data data/raw_data data/tidy_data

mkdir code code/raw_code code/final_code

mkdir figures figures/exploratory figures/explanatory

mkdir products products/writing
```
